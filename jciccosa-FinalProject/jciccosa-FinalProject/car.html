<h2>Cars</h2>

<h3>BMW E46 330ci</h3>

<p>
This is the current car in which I drive on a daily basis. It is a five speed manual, and it is what I would call
a daily drift car. I plan on modifying it for the purpose of sliding it on the track in the future. It is the dark
blue car shown in the photo below.

<h3>BMW E82 135i</h3>

<p>
This is my project car that I like to call a garage ornament. After extensive investment and modification,
the car produces over 700HP. It is representative of what I aspire for as a car enthusiast. It is the orange
car shown above.

<p>
The video shown is a race that I built up to participate in for over one year. My vehicle (orange)
is going against a Nissan GTR with over $200,000 invested.
</p>

<h3>BMW E85 Z4</h3>

<p>
This was the car that started my enthusiast journey, it taught me a lot about how I can pursue cars
as both a hobby as well as a potential career path and use them to make money in general.
