<h2>Weightlifting</h2>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
I started weightlifting seriously in the year 2017. My motivations were somewhat different and disorganized compared to most.
My whole life, like many young men, I had wanted a six pack. I was chubby beforehand and chose to simply go on a diet. Over
the course of 3 months, I went from 165 to 125 pounds (I am 5'6"). In losing these forty pounds, I had achieved my goals,
but now, I had to find a way to mantain the rebound weight gain such that I could still have the physique I desired. After
a month or so of doing cardio post-weight loss, I decided I hate cardio and would rather weight train. I have been lifting since
this moment, over four years, and have managed to maintain the physique I once desired and am overall quite happy with myself.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>
At this point, I am hovering around 130 pounds, plus or minus two. My strength is relatively high, though, somewhat below my
personal records, with a max bench press of 250lb, squat of 365lb, overhead press of 150lb and deadlift of 405lb. I am at a bit
of a crossroads here. Through my goal of desiring an incredibly low body fat percentage (6%) I am also rather small for a bodybuilder.
I am hoping to be able to maintain a low body fat like this with a higher muscle mass. Ideally, I would say that I would maintain this
level of leanness at a weight of around 140lb.

<h3>Routine</h3>

<p>
I have chosen to share the bulk of my tricep routine as they are my strongest muscle group, having a relative
muscle mass of 117% compared to my other body parts. It is not clear if this is a result of genetics or training regime.
