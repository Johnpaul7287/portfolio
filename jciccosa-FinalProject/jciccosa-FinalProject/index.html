<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		 Hello all, my name is Johnpaul Ciccosanti, I am a Biomedical Engineering student at
		 Arizona State University, I was also a member of the Barrett Honors College for some of
		 my time here. In regard to education, I have a strong passion for Biology and am primarily
		 interested in how far we can take the human body from the standpoint of genetic manipulation.
		 Moreover, my passions have diversified over the years and while I still hold that same strong 
		 passion, I now understand how the various fields intertwine an am looking to dwelve into the
		 field of Mechanical Engineering, particularely, fluid dynamics and or nanorobotics. I am
		 relatively open and am curious to see where my educational pursuits will take me.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		 Given that I am an open person, many of my hobbies and passions are varied and not necessarily
		 correlated in any standard way. I will try pretty much anything at least once given that open-minded
		 mindset. Currently, my main hobbies consist of working on and modifying performance vehicles, bodybuilding
		 and nutrition, as well as some computer gaming. However, this is a much simplified list and there are many
		 others things that I could passionately talk about all day.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		 The primary goal of this website is to essentially serve as a portfolio of my life and activities. While making
		 such a website does seem rather conceited, I think that it is important considering that with such a diversified
		 set of skills and interests, it is hard to concisely answer simple questions such as "what do you like to do"
		 or "what type of person are you". I am hoping that this website will primarily be used for employment purposes,
		 or perhaps as a resume of some sort, or used to find a business partner. However, in the future, if I am able
		 to be successful in any of the projects or businesses that I am planning on creating, I think that the website
		 could easily be modified to contain things like a store or products, perhaps I consider it the beginning of
		 something great.
