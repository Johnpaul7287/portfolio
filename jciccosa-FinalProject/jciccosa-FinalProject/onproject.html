<h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>

<h3>Portfiolo Website Development</h3>

<p>
Currently, I am working on my website development skills through the process of creating this website in the context of both HTML
and CSS. This website may end up serving as the basis of any future companies I launch, and their origin will likely be noted
here within this existing website. This website is a work in progress but will likely be finalized and archived within the coming
weeks, though future updates may ensue.
</p>

<h3>SolidWorks Development</h3>

<p>
I am working on a variety of products related to the automotive industry. Aside from practicing my skills in a less practical way
from a development standpoint (in regard to designing parts that will likely never reach production), I am also working on more
feasible products such as a motorsport inspired phone mounting device.
