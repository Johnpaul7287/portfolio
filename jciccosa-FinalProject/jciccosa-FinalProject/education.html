<h2>Education</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a></h3>

<p>
I am currently a Biomedical Engineering student at Arizona State University. It is my third
year of attendance and I will be graduating with my bachelors degree in Spring 2022. I am
looking to move toward the Mechanical Engineering field and will be taking electives accordingly
in the spring. After graduation, I am hoping to pursue a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering
at this institution such that I can diversify my skillset to be more lucrative in both the work
force as well as my own individual endeavors.

<h3><a href="https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/">Pierce College</a></h3>

<p>
I attended Pierce Community College between Fall 2017 and Spring 2019. I earned two separate 
associate degrees, one in Biology and the other in the arts. I was a member of the Pi Theta
Kappa honors society and earned a GPA of 3.93 and 3.92 in my degrees respectively. 
</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.ortingschools.org/Domain/11">Orting High School</a></h3>

<p>
I attended Orting High School primarily for two years before I attending community college as a 
member of Washington state's running start program. While in attendance, I completed some AP courses
and later on chose to continue taking spanish courses despite attending Pierce Community college in
my junior and senior year of high school. During this time, I earned a cumulative GPA of 3.83 and was
also a member of National Honors Society in which I committed much of my time to servicing my community
with over 100 total hours of service despite my busy schedule.
